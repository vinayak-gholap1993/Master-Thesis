Modelling of instabilities in magnetoelastic membranes
Thin materials may exhibit instabilities when placed under large loads. In addition to the
commonly known buckling phenomena that occurs under compressive loading, thin tubular
membranes also demonstrate a further limit point elastic instability leading to sudden large
deformations when placed under hydrostatic load. Magnetoelastic membranes, that may have
application in structural and aerospace engineering for example, are subject to further limit
point instabilities related to an applied magnetic load. It is desired that the unstable beha-
viour of these magnetic field-responsive tubular membranes be examined using computational
methods.
This work would entail
• the implementation and validation of a 2-d axisymmetric formulation for the quasi-
static magento-elastic problem using the scalar potential formulation. This will be used
to model the magnetoelastic material and surrounding free-space through which the
magnetic field permeates;
• the implementation of an adaptive meshing scheme to accurately capture the response
of the thin structure; and
• the implementation of a robust non-linear scheme from the literature to render the
solution under unstable conditions.

This work will be conducted using the open-source, high-performance deal.II finite
element library.
